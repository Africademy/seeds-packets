## Usage

### Best Practices

#### User initiated interactions (dismiss, hide, send, etc..)
Use deceleration to remove from screen to shift user’s focus elsewhere

#### System reactions (alerts, warnings, errors, notifications)
Use acceleration to shift user's attention

#### Fades and color changes
Use linear motion to communicate a consistent start to finish of an action


### Do’s and Don’ts

- **DO:** Use natural movement – remain true to real world physics.
- **DO:** Be Intentional and aware – animations should have a purpose.
- **DO:** Be subtle – make animations brief to avoid user discomfort and anxiety.
- **DO:** Add charisma – make the user feel anticipation and delight.
