## Best practices

**Sprout Primary:**
Primary brand colors are used for elements that reflect Sprout's brand.

- Green 500 is our primary color reserved for primary actions. Green
 500 should call attention to only the most important elements of
 design.
- Tints 100-300 &amp; 900 should be avoided in marketing illustration and design.

**Sprout Secondary:**
Secondary colors are used sparingly as accents.

- Link to context specific guidelines for more specific use cases (e.g. illustration).
- A broad secondary palette is necessary for group colors and data viz.
- Use analogous color schemes for grouping.

- Red 700 is used for destructive actions and errors.

**Bambu:**
Primary brand colors are used for elements that reflect Bambu's brand. 

- BambuTeal 400 is our primary color reserved for primary actions. Teal 400 should call attention to only the most important elements of design. 
- Yellow 500 is reserved for CTA buttons on the marketing page.
- When unsure of usage defer to Sprout's guidelines

**Grays:**
The palette of the gray shades should be used for illustration, product and marketing elements.

- Do not use any tints or shades or add any more grays to this palette.
- Use opacity as a tool to draw attention to an element in the
 foreground.
