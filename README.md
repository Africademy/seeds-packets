# SEEDS
Sprout's Exquisitely Executed Design System

## Development

We use [Lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage inter-package dependencies in this monorepo. Builds are orchestrated via [Gulp 4](http://gulpjs.com/) tasks.

### Building packages

To build SEEDS packages, simply install dependencies by running `yarn` and build tokens and documentation with `yarn build`.
